Assignments: <br>
Each week there will be short compositions assignments due for participation points that we will share in class. <br>
There will be a final project that will need to be presented at the MST concert in May. <br>
Finally, you will need to attend and help tech concerts throughout the semester. The first concert that you will need to attend (not tech) is <b> January 31st at noon </b> on the Music At Midday series at Rogers Memorial Chapel.<br><br>
